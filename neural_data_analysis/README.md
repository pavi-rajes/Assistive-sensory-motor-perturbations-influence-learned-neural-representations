# Demo scripts for neural data analysis
This folder includes demo code and sample data for running the notebooks. The intent of this demo code is to help users understand the analysis conducted in our study. Please note that the figures presented in the paper cannot be replicated exactly using this sample dataset. The complete code and data for the full analysis are available upon reasonable request.

## Structure 
 - dimensionality.ipynb contains dimensionality analysis using participation ratio used in Figure 2
 - credit_assignment.ipynb contains logistic regression analysis used in Figure 3 
 - compactness.ipynb contains ranked neuron adding curve related analysis used in Figure 4 and 6 

 ## Getting started 

Before running the scripts, you'll need to create or update your Python environment using the `requirements.txt` file. This ensures that all dependencies are correctly installed.
